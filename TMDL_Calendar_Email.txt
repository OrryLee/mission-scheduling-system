Subject: Common Operational Picture Calendar - TMDL Script for Power BI

Dear [Recipient],

I am providing you with the complete TMDL (Tabular Model Definition Language) script for implementing a Common Operational Picture Calendar with integrated conflict detection for military mission scheduling.

SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
This TMDL script creates a comprehensive calendar-focused dashboard that connects all SharePoint lists into a unified operational view with automated soldier conflict detection and notifications.

KEY FEATURES:
✅ Traditional Calendar View - Main display showing all missions and Vista events
✅ Click Event Details - Detailed information from Mission Requirements, Personnel Roster, and Grizzly Vista Data
✅ Red Conflict Highlighting - Automatic detection when soldiers are double-booked
✅ Side Panel Alerts - Conflict notifications with resolution tracking
✅ Rolling Time Filters - 30/60/90 day views for operational planning
✅ Integrated Data Sources - Mission Calendar + Grizzly Vista Data unified display
✅ Role-Based Security - Mission Planners, Command Staff, and Vista Users access levels

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- 7 Connected Tables: Personnel_Roster, Mission_Calendar, Mission_Requirements, Grizzly_Vista_Data, Conflict_Log, DateTable, ConflictDetection
- 14 DAX Measures: Mission counts, conflict tracking, utilization metrics, event details
- Automated Conflict Detection: Real-time overlap detection between Mission Calendar and Grizzly Vista events
- Color Coding: Status-based colors (Planned=Orange, Active=Green, Conflicts=Red)
- Enterprise Features: SharePoint embedding, PDF export, PowerPoint integration

CONFLICT DETECTION LOGIC:
The system automatically creates a ConflictDetection table that:
1. Combines events from Mission_Calendar and Grizzly_Vista_Data
2. Cross-references personnel assignments by DOD_ID
3. Identifies time overlaps using date/time calculations
4. Generates conflict alerts with severity levels (High/Medium/Low)
5. Provides resolution tracking through Conflict_Log integration

DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Copy the attached TMDL script text
2. Open Power BI Desktop
3. Go to External Tools > Tabular Editor (or use File > Import)
4. Paste the TMDL script to create the complete model
5. Update SharePoint site URL in the script (line references provided)
6. Deploy to Power BI Service for sharing and embedding

CALENDAR FUNCTIONALITY:
- Main Calendar Display: Shows both Mission Calendar and Grizzly Vista events
- Event Click Details: Personnel assignments, requirements, locations, conflicts
- Side Panel Alerts: Real-time conflict notifications with resolution options
- Time Navigation: Rolling 30/60/90 day views with today highlighting
- Status Color Coding: Visual indicators for mission status and conflicts
- Export Capabilities: PDF reports and PowerPoint briefing slides

SHAREPOINT INTEGRATION:
- Direct REST API connections to all SharePoint lists
- Real-time data synchronization (configurable refresh schedule)
- Maintains SharePoint security permissions
- Supports both manual data entry and automated imports

SECURITY MODEL:
- Mission Planners: Unit-level access to assigned personnel and missions
- Command Staff: Full access to all data across units
- Vista Users: Limited access to Grizzly Vista Data and related personnel
- Row-level security based on Unit/Company assignments

CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:
- Update SharePoint site URLs for your environment
- Modify color schemes and visual themes
- Add additional data sources or calculated fields
- Customize conflict detection rules and severity levels
- Extend role-based security for additional user types

SUPPORT INFORMATION:
- Complete source code: https://github.com/OrryLee/mission-scheduling-system
- TMDL script includes detailed comments and annotations
- All DAX measures documented with business logic explanations
- Relationship definitions clearly specified for data integrity

NEXT STEPS:
1. Review and customize the TMDL script for your SharePoint environment
2. Test deployment in development Power BI workspace
3. Configure user permissions and role assignments
4. Set up automated refresh schedule for real-time updates
5. Train users on calendar navigation and conflict resolution procedures

The system provides a complete Common Operational Picture with automated conflict detection, significantly improving mission coordination and reducing scheduling errors. All components are production-ready with comprehensive error handling and security controls.

Please let me know if you need assistance with deployment or customization of the TMDL script.
